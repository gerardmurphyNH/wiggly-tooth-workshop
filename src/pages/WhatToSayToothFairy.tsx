    question: "Should I tell my child the Tooth Fairy is real?",
    answer:
      "It depends on what your child is really asking. Some children want reassurance. Others are ready for a more grown-up answer. You don't have to force a yes-or-no. You can preserve wonder without forcing literal belief — and a thoughtful answer often means more to a child than a quick confirmation either way.",
  },
  {
    question: "What age do kids stop believing in the Tooth Fairy?",
    answer:
      "Many children begin questioning the Tooth Fairy between ages 7 and 9, though every child is different. Some ask earlier, especially if they have older siblings or friends who have already had the conversation. There is no single right age — the timing usually comes naturally when a child is ready.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it lying to let kids believe in the Tooth Fairy?",
    answer:
      "Many parents see the Tooth Fairy as a tradition rather than a lie. The key is how you handle the question when your child asks directly. A thoughtful answer can honor the tradition while respecting your child's growing understanding — and can help them see that the meaning behind the tradition is real, even if the details are ones the family creates together.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I say if my child asks who leaves the money?",
    answer:
      "You can say that the money is a thank-you and a celebration of the child growing up. If your child is ready for more, you can explain that parents help keep the tradition alive — and that being the one who keeps a little wonder going for someone else is its own kind of magic.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I keep an older child from ruining it for younger siblings?",
    answer:
      "Invite them into the tradition. Let them know that growing up sometimes means becoming one of the people who helps keep wonder alive for someone else. Most children respond well to being trusted with that — it gives them a new role instead of just taking something away.",

                Here is one way to answer when your child asks if the Tooth Fairy is real:
              </p>
              <blockquote className="rounded-2xl border border-primary/20 bg-primary/5 px-8 md:px-10 py-8 space-y-4 text-foreground leading-loose text-[15px]">

                </p>
                <p>
                  Your baby teeth have been with you through some really important years. They
                  were there while you learned to walk, learned to read, made friends, got brave,
                  got hurt, tried new things, and slowly became more you.
                </p>
                <p>That's why losing a tooth feels like such a big milestone.</p>
                <p>
                  An adult tooth means you're changing. Growing. Becoming stronger and more
                  independent. And honestly, as your parent, that's exciting for me to watch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Tooth Fairy story exists because people have always known there's something
                  important about that moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adults don't understand everything about the world either. But we do know this:
                  the qualities you grow inside yourself matter. Your kindness matters. Your
                  courage matters. Your creativity matters. The way you treat people matters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And maybe the Tooth Fairy has always been a way of reminding kids not to lose
                  those things as they grow up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The money isn't really a payment for a tooth. It's more like a small
                  celebration of who you're becoming — and a reminder that growing up should
                  help you make the world a little better in your own way.
                </p>
                <p>Some people stop looking for magic as they get older.</p>
                <p>
                  But the people who hold onto wonder a little longer often notice things other
                  people miss."

                  This answer does not force your child to keep believing something they may

                <p>
                  At Wiggly Tooth Workshop, we believe losing a tooth is more than a transaction
                  under a pillow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A tooth has been with a child through years of growing, learning, trying,
                  failing, laughing, imagining, and becoming. That makes it worth celebrating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Tooth Fairy tradition works best when it reminds children that the qualities
                  they grow inside themselves matter — kindness, courage, patience, creativity,
                  curiosity, and wonder.
                </p>
                <p>Those qualities do not disappear when children grow up.</p>
                <p>If anything, growing up is the chance to carry them forward.</p>
