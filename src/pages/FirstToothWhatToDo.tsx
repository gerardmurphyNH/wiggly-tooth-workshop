    title: "Stay calm — even if there's a little blood",
    body: "A tiny bit of blood is completely normal when a baby tooth comes out. Rinse with cold water and press a clean cloth gently against the spot for a minute or two. It stops quickly.",
  },
  {
    title: "Find somewhere special to keep the tooth",
    body: "Before the Tooth Fairy can visit, the tooth needs a safe place to wait. Some families use a small pouch under the pillow. Some use a special tooth box on the bedside table. The Tooth Fairy is good at finding both.",
  },
  {
    title: "Let the child decide how much they want to know",
    body: "Some children want to know everything — what the Tooth Fairy does, why she comes, where the tooth goes. Others just want to know the coin will be there in the morning. Both are fine. Follow their lead.",
  },
  {
    title: "Make something of the moment",
    body: "The first lost tooth only happens once. Write the date down. Take a photo with the gap-toothed smile. Tell them something true: you grew that tooth. It held something real. And now it gets to go somewhere important.",

  {
    question: "What age do children usually lose their first tooth?",
    answer:
      "Most children lose their first tooth between ages 5 and 7, though anywhere from 4 to 8 is completely normal. The bottom front teeth (lower central incisors) usually come out first — the same ones that came in first when they were a baby.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I pull out a loose tooth or wait?",
    answer:
      "It's almost always better to wait. A tooth will come out when it's ready — and a tooth that comes out on its own is much less uncomfortable than one that's pulled too early. If it's very loose and hanging by a thread, a gentle wiggle is fine. If it's just loose, let it wiggle itself out.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my child swallows their tooth by accident?",
    answer:
      "It happens, and it's nothing to worry about medically. The Tooth Fairy also understands — just leave a note explaining what happened. She's been doing this long enough to have encountered every possible situation, and she appreciates the honesty.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does the Tooth Fairy leave?",
    answer:
      "This varies a lot between families. The average in the United States is around $4–5 per tooth, though it ranges from coins to $20 for a first tooth. There's no official amount — the Tooth Fairy adjusts for circumstances. What matters more than the amount is that the exchange feels meaningful.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the Tooth Fairy doesn't come the first night?",
    answer:
      "It happens. The Tooth Fairy visits millions of children — sometimes she runs a little behind schedule. If the tooth is still there in the morning, just reassure your child that the Fairy will come the next night. She always finds a way.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I keep my child's baby teeth?",
    answer:
      "Many families do. Some keep all of them, some keep just the first. Baby teeth are a physical record of childhood — small, surprising, and gone before you know it. If you want to keep them, the Tooth Fairy understands. The virtues inside a kept tooth stay with the family.",

                Children ask this question at some point — and it's a good one.
                The answer, in full, is on the pages below. But the short version:
              </p>
              <p>
                The Tooth Fairy takes every tooth to her workshop. Inside each tooth
                is something she calls a virtue — bravery, kindness, creativity, or patience —
                grown during the years the tooth was in your child's mouth.
                She carefully extracts that virtue and sends it back out into the world
                to help people who need it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then she leaves a coin as a thank-you. Because what she took was
                genuinely valuable. And she knows it.
