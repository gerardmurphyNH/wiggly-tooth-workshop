    question: "Why does the Tooth Fairy leave money?",
    answer:
      "The money isn't a payment for the tooth. It's a thank-you. The Tooth Fairy leaves something behind to acknowledge that the tooth mattered - that the quality the child grew inside it was real, and that it's now off helping the world somewhere. The gift is the gesture, not the price.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the money a payment for the tooth?",
    answer:
      "No. A payment would mean the tooth was bought and sold. That's not what's happening. The Tooth Fairy isn't buying anything - she's saying thank you for something a child gave freely, and acknowledging the courage, kindness, or patience that grew inside it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does the Tooth Fairy usually leave?",
    answer:
      "Most families land somewhere between a few coins and a few dollars, with first teeth often getting a little extra. The exact amount matters far less than the gesture. You can read more on our page about how much the Tooth Fairy leaves.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the Tooth Fairy sometimes leave coins instead of bills?",
    answer:
      "Coins often feel more magical to a young child - they have weight, they catch the light, they jingle. A single special coin left with care can mean more than a larger bill left in silence. The Tooth Fairy tends to choose what feels meaningful over what's worth most.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the Tooth Fairy always leave money?",
    answer:
      "Not always, and it doesn't have to be money at all. A small note, a tiny token, or a keepsake can carry the same thank-you. What matters is that something is left behind to mark that the visit happened and the tooth was received with care.",

          Why Does the Tooth Fairy Leave Money?
        </h1>

        <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          It's the question every child eventually asks, usually right after the
          first coin appears. The answer is gentler than you might expect.
        </p>

        {/* Direct answer */}
        <div className="mb-10 p-6 rounded-2xl bg-secondary/40 border border-border">
          <p className="text-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <span className="font-display font-bold">The short answer:</span> the
            money isn't a payment for the tooth. It's a thank-you - a quiet way of
            saying the tooth mattered, and that the quality the child grew inside
            it is now off helping the world.
          </p>

        <div className="space-y-6">
          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">
            A thank-you, not a payment
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            A payment would mean the tooth was bought - traded for cash like
            anything else. That's not what's happening here. When a child loses a
            tooth, they're giving up something that quietly held a piece of who
            they're becoming: their bravery, their kindness, their patience. The
            Tooth Fairy doesn't buy that. She receives it, with care, and leaves
            something behind to say thank you.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">
            Why something is always left behind
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            The gift is really an acknowledgment. It says: I was here, your tooth
            was received, and the work you did growing that quality was real and
            worth something. For a child, finding a coin where a tooth used to be
            is proof that the exchange meant something to someone else, too.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            That's why what's left behind matters more than how much. A coin
            chosen with care, a tiny note, a small keepsake - any of these can
            carry the same thank-you.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">
            Coins, bills, and what actually lands
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Coins often feel more magical to a young child than bills. They have
            weight and shine, they catch the light, and a single special coin can
            mean more than a larger amount left in silence. If you want the gift
            to feel like it came from the Tooth Fairy, lean into the small,
            thoughtful details rather than the dollar amount.
          </p>
