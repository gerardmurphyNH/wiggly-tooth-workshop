    question: "Is the Tooth Fairy real?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The Tooth Fairy is real - she just works in ways most people never see. She visits at night, takes the tooth a child has lost, and draws out the quality that grew inside it while it was theirs: courage, kindness, patience, creativity. Those qualities are real, and so is what she does with them. You may never catch sight of her, but the evidence is left behind every time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the Tooth Fairy take teeth?",
    answer:
      "Not because the teeth themselves are valuable, but because of what's inside them. Every tooth quietly absorbs the qualities a child grows - bravery from facing something scary, kindness from helping, patience from waiting. The Tooth Fairy collects those qualities and uses them to gently help keep the world in balance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why doesn't the Tooth Fairy let anyone see her?",
    answer:
      "Partly because she works better unseen, and partly because the mystery is part of how the tradition works. A visitor who leaves something in the night is wondrous; a visitor you can watch is just a person. Most important things - courage, kindness, the wind - work quietly. The Tooth Fairy fits right in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the Tooth Fairy real, or is it your parents?",
    answer:
      "It's the question every child eventually asks - and the honest answer is: both can be true. Parents help. They always have, slipping the coin under the pillow on the nights the Tooth Fairy can't make it. But the part that isn't pretend is what the tradition is really about: the courage, kindness, and wonder a child grows are real, and they really do matter. Parents are the Tooth Fairy's helpers, not her replacement. The magic is in what your child is becoming.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I tell my child when they ask if the Tooth Fairy is real?",
    answer:
      "You don't have to settle it in a single sentence. A gentle answer is to ask what they think, then lean into what's true underneath the story: the courage, kindness, and creativity the Tooth Fairy looks for are real qualities your child really is growing. The wonder and the honesty can both stay.",

                Childhood is full of invisible work. Every time a child tries
                something frightening, a small piece of courage takes shape.
                Every moment of patience, every act of kindness, every
                afternoon spent building something from nothing - all of it
                accumulates. Not in any place you can point to. But somewhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Teeth grow slowly, over years, through all of it. A first loose
                tooth arrives after a childhood of small acts - fears faced,
                kindness offered, persistence practiced in quiet rooms. When it
                finally falls, it doesn't leave empty.

                There's an old idea at the heart of the Tooth Fairy story - one
                that most people overlook because they're too focused on the
                coin or bill left behind.

                Baby teeth don't just hold the shape of a child's smile. Over
                the years they form, they quietly absorb the qualities a child
                brings into the world. Not as wishes. Not as magic. But as
                something real and earned.

              <p>
                They don't stop to wonder about the tooth that disappeared -
                where it went, what it carried, or why someone took such care to
                leave something in its place.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Tooth Fairy's work is ancient and mostly unseen. She works
                while the world sleeps, when the noise has stopped and things
                can finally settle. Small corrections. Quiet contributions. Acts
                of balance too subtle to announce but too important to leave
                undone.
              </p>
              <p>
                She is less like a magical entertainer and more like a careful
                keeper of something most of us forget to notice: that children,
                simply by growing, make the world better.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every child who faces something frightening and tries anyway.
                Every child who learns to be patient, to share, to imagine, to
                keep going. All of that is real. All of it accumulates. None of
                it disappears - even when the tooth does.
