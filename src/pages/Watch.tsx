              <p>
                <em>The Tooth Fairy's Secret Workshop</em> follows Arlo, a curious
                boy who loses a tooth and asks the question many children wonder
                about: what does the Tooth Fairy actually do with my tooth - and
                why?
              </p>
              <p>
                The answer leads to a discovery. Every lost tooth quietly holds a
                quality the child grew while it was theirs - courage, kindness,
                patience, creativity - and the Tooth Fairy uses those qualities to
                help make the world a little better. The film was created in
                collaboration with Peter H. Reynolds and FableVision Studios.
