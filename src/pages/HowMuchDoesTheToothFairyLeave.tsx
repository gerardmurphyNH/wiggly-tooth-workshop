    question: "How much does the Tooth Fairy usually leave per tooth?",
    answer:
      "Recent American surveys put the average somewhere between $3 and $6 per tooth, with first teeth often getting a premium. Some families give $10 or $20 for a first tooth; some give less. All of these are fine - consistency matters more than the exact amount.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should the first tooth get more than the rest?",
    answer:
      "Many parents give more for the first tooth - it's a milestone and it takes courage. In the Wiggly Tooth Workshop telling, first teeth hold the most concentrated quality, which is why the Tooth Fairy values them most highly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the Tooth Fairy leave money?",
    answer:
      "The money isn't a payment for the tooth. It's a thank-you for the quality you grew inside it - your bravery, your kindness, your patience. It's the Tooth Fairy's way of saying the tooth mattered, the growing was real, and what was inside is now off to help someone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the amount really matter to children?",
    answer:
      "Less than you'd think. A small note, a few coins with some heft and jingle, or a tiny certificate often lands better than a larger bill left in silence. The ritual is what children remember.",
  },

        <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          There's no single right answer — the Tooth Fairy's exchange rate has never
          been officially standardized. But there are useful patterns, reasonable
          ranges, and a few things worth knowing before you set the amount.
        </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">
            What surveys say
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            In recent years, American surveys have put the average Tooth Fairy payment
            somewhere between $3 and $6 per tooth, with first teeth often getting a
            premium. Some families go higher — $10 or $20 for a first tooth is not
            unheard of. Some families are more modest. All of these are fine.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            The national average has generally trended upward over time, tracking
            roughly with inflation and with what other parents report to their children.
            Kids compare notes.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">
            The "first tooth" question
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Many parents give more for the first tooth — it's a milestone, it takes
            courage, and there's a symbolic weight to it. If you give $5 for the first
            tooth and $2 for subsequent ones, most children accept this graciously once
            it's explained that first teeth are particularly rare and special.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            The Wiggly Tooth Workshop version of this: first teeth hold the most
            concentrated virtue, which is why the Tooth Fairy values them most highly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">
            Practical considerations
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Whatever you choose, consistency matters more than the specific amount.
            Children discuss. If the Tooth Fairy is giving $10 at a friend's house and
            $2 at yours, be prepared for a negotiation. Having a family rate you
            stick to is simpler than trying to explain fluctuating market conditions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Coins often land better with younger children than bills — the physical
            heft and jingle of coins feels more magical, even if the dollar amount is
            lower.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">
            Beyond the money
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Some families write a small note from the Tooth Fairy. Some leave glitter
            footprints. Some include a tiny certificate. None of these require large
            sums — a well-executed note often lands better than a $20 bill left in
            silence.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            If you're looking for something tangible, the ToothSafe from Wiggly Tooth
            Workshop is designed to make the whole ritual — the leaving, the waiting,
            the finding — feel special.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">
            Why does the Tooth Fairy leave money?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            The money isn't a payment, and the tooth isn't really being bought. What the
            Tooth Fairy is thanking you for is the quality you grew inside that tooth -
            the bravery, the kindness, the patience that gathered there while it was
            yours. The coin under the pillow is her way of saying that the tooth
            mattered.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Think of it as a small token of exchange rather than a price. You gave her
            something that took years to grow, and she gives a little something back so
            the trade feels real on both sides. It's an acknowledgment: the growing was
            worth noticing, and what was inside is now off to help someone, somewhere.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            That's also why the exact amount matters less than the gesture. A few coins
            left with care says the same thing a larger bill does - I see what you grew,
            and the world needed it. The money is just how she leaves a thank-you a child
            can hold.
