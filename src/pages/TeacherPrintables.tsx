  {
    question: "What is SEL?",
    answer:
      "SEL stands for social-emotional learning. In early elementary classrooms, SEL helps children recognize feelings, name positive qualities, build empathy, and understand how their actions affect others. These printables use a familiar childhood milestone — losing a tooth — as a gentle, age-appropriate entry point.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does losing a tooth connect to SEL?",
    answer:
      "Losing a tooth is a milestone most first and second graders share. This activity uses that moment to help children reflect on kindness, bravery, effort, creativity, and persistence — the small actions that help them grow. It turns a routine event into a quiet, personal reflection.",
  },
  {
    question: "What grade level is this for?",
    answer:
      "These printables are designed for first and second grade students — the age when most children are actively losing teeth and when SEL concepts like self-reflection and naming positive qualities are developmentally right. Kindergarten and third grade teachers often find them useful too, depending on the class.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are these Tooth Fairy printables free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All three resources — the worksheet, the coloring page, and the teacher guide — are free to download and use. No account or sign-up required. Print as many copies as you need.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can teachers use these in the classroom?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. These were designed with classroom use in mind. The teacher guide includes a full lesson plan, discussion prompts, and instructions for turning the activity into a repeatable tradition. Every time a student loses a tooth, the worksheet is ready for them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can parents use this at home?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The worksheet and coloring page both work well at home when a child loses a tooth. The teacher guide includes notes on involving families, and the worksheet is designed to be kept.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes these Tooth Fairy activities different?",
    answer:
      "Most Tooth Fairy content focuses on the tooth, the money, or the magic. These activities focus on the child: on noticing what they've been growing and giving that a name. The goal is reflection and curiosity, not just reward.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the activity take?",
    answer:
      "The full lesson, including the worksheet and coloring page, takes about 15–20 minutes. The worksheet alone takes about 10–15 minutes. Once you've done the lesson once, the routine version takes about five minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I download just one resource?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Each file is a separate PDF. Download whichever one you need. The worksheet, coloring page, and teacher guide are all available individually on this page.",
  },
  {
    question: "What curriculum standards does this support?",
    answer:
      "The activity supports CASEL competencies around self-awareness and self-management, and connects to personal narrative writing for grades 1–2. It's not tied to a specific curriculum and is designed to be flexible.",

              Looking for Tooth Fairy worksheets and printables for your classroom or home?
            </p>
            <p>
              These free Tooth Fairy printables are designed to support social-emotional learning (SEL) for first and second graders while keeping the magic of losing a tooth alive. They give children a way to mark a milestone most of them will remember — and to reflect on something real in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is not just to celebrate losing a tooth. It's to help children notice what they've been growing while they had it. Bravery when something was hard. Kindness when someone needed it. Creativity when there was no obvious answer. Patience when waiting was difficult. In this version of the story, the Tooth Fairy collects those qualities and uses them to quietly help fix small problems in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              All three resources are free to download and print. No sign-up required.

                    Losing a tooth is already a big moment for young children. These activities use that moment to help students reflect on the good things they are growing inside themselves — like kindness, bravery, creativity, patience, and persistence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The worksheet, teacher guide, and coloring page encourage children to connect their actions to who they are becoming. It is a simple, age-appropriate way to support self-awareness, classroom conversation, and positive identity-building.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Use it once as a class activity, then keep extra copies nearby. Each time a student loses a tooth, invite them to complete a new worksheet and reflect on what they have been growing lately. Over time, losing a tooth becomes more than a milestone — it becomes a small classroom tradition.

                      Not in a physical sense. It asks about qualities that grow slowly, that you only notice when something tests them. Children ages 5–8 can complete it independently or with a little guidance. It works as a standalone activity or as the reflective piece of a larger lesson.

                      It gives the reflection something physical to hold onto: a picture to take home, a jar to label, a moment to sit with quietly. Works well as a classroom extension activity, a take-home project, or a gentle entry point for younger children who aren't quite ready for the full worksheet.

                      The two-page guide explains the idea behind the activity, walks through a structured 15–20 minute lesson, and includes discussion prompts to use before and after the worksheet. The core question it helps teachers ask: why does the Tooth Fairy care about what you've been growing?

                    <p>
                      It also explains how to build this into an ongoing classroom routine. Keep a stack of worksheets ready. When a student loses a tooth, hand them one and ask: what do you think you've been growing lately? By the end of the year, every child who lost a tooth has had that quiet moment to notice.
