The blanks let you personalise it with your child's name, their quality, and the small thing the Tooth Fairy did with the magic.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I personalise this Tooth Fairy letter?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The template has blanks for your child's name, their special quality (like courage or kindness), how that quality has been growing, and what the Tooth Fairy did with the magic from the tooth. The parent guide section on this page has prompts to help you choose each one.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should the Tooth Fairy leave money with the letter?",
    answer:
      "Many families do. In this version, the money is a thank-you, not a payment. The letter frames it that way: the money is left because the tooth mattered, because of the qualities it held — not simply as a transaction.",
  },
  {
    question: "What age is this Tooth Fairy letter best for?",
    answer:
      "This works especially well for children around ages 5–8, when losing teeth still feels magical and the ideas of courage, kindness, and curiosity are just starting to become meaningful. Older children who still enjoy the tradition may appreciate a more detailed version.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should my child's first Tooth Fairy letter say?",
    answer:
      "A first Tooth Fairy letter is a keepsake, so it helps to slow down and make it personal. Thank your child for their very first lost tooth, tell them it's a moment worth remembering, and name one real quality you've watched growing in them - the courage it took, the kindness they showed, the patience they're learning. You can use the printable template above and simply fill the blanks with that first-tooth moment in mind.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can teachers use this Tooth Fairy letter?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Teachers can use the letter idea alongside the free Tooth Fairy worksheet and teacher guide to create a small classroom tradition around lost teeth. Each time a student loses a tooth, the letter and worksheet together make the moment feel significant. See the free printables page for the full classroom resource.",

              <p>Losing a tooth is a big moment.</p>
              <p>
                Most people know the tradition: place the tooth under your pillow, fall asleep,
                and wake up to find money in its place.
              </p>
              <p>
                But very few people know what really happens next.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Tooth Fairy collects teeth because every child's tooth holds something
                special that has been growing over time — courage, kindness, creativity,
                patience, curiosity, wonder, and more. Those qualities help make the world
                a little brighter in quiet ways most people never notice.
              </p>
              <p>
                This free printable Tooth Fairy letter helps continue the magic of that moment.
                Each letter can celebrate the special qualities growing inside your child and
                remind them that even small acts of bravery, kindness, and curiosity matter
                more than they realise.

                <p>
                  Thank you for leaving your tooth where I could find it safely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I examined it very carefully tonight, and I discovered something special

                <p>
                  Your tooth held a strong spark of <Blank />.

                  Many grown-ups forget that children are still becoming who they are meant to
                  be. But every lost tooth tells part of the story. Yours showed signs of
                  someone who is learning, growing, and helping make the world a little better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tonight, I used a little bit of the magic from your tooth to help{" "}

                <p>Even small qualities can make a very big difference.</p>
                <p>
                  I left this money as a thank-you for your tooth and the important qualities
                  growing inside you.

                <p>
                  Please continue brushing carefully. Clean, healthy teeth hold onto their
                  magic much better.

                miracles happen. A little bit of tooth magic might help an animal, brighten a
                dark path, calm a worried heart, or nudge a small moment in the right
                direction.

              Writing your child's first Tooth Fairy letter
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-5 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                A first tooth is a once-in-a-lifetime moment, so the first Tooth Fairy letter
                is worth a little extra care. It's the one most likely to be kept, tucked into
                a memory box, and read again years later. You don't need fancy words - you need
                the moment to feel true.
              </p>
              <p>
                Start by thanking your child for their very first tooth and telling them it's a
                day worth remembering. Then say what you've quietly noticed: a real quality
                that's been growing in them. Maybe it was the bravery of wiggling the tooth
                themselves, the patience of waiting for it to come loose, or the kindness they
                showed someone that week. Naming one true quality is what turns a sweet note
                into something they'll feel.

                is made for exactly this. The blanks let you write their name, the quality you
                saw growing, and the small thing the Tooth Fairy did with its magic - so a first
                letter feels personal without you having to start from a blank page.

              A letter like this also gives you a gentle way into the bigger question when it
              comes. The qualities the Tooth Fairy notices - courage, kindness, patience,
              creativity - are real whether or not your child still pictures a winged fairy, and
              that's a comforting truth to lean on. For the actual words to use in that moment,
