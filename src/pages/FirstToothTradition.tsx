    question: "What is a first tooth tradition?",
    answer:
      "A first tooth tradition is a small ritual families create around a child's first lost tooth. Instead of focusing only on money under the pillow, it marks the milestone as meaningful. In the Wiggly Tooth Workshop tradition, the Tooth Fairy leaves a keepsake certificate that names a special quality she found growing inside the child - turning a routine moment into one worth remembering.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do when my child loses their first tooth?",
    answer:
      "Place the tooth under the pillow as usual, and before bed, talk together about something your child has been growing lately - a moment of kindness, bravery, or patience. In the morning, the Tooth Fairy's thank-you and her certificate are waiting. The certificate becomes a keepsake of the tooth and the child they were when they lost it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a printable Tooth Fairy certificate?",
    answer:
      "It's a free printable certificate designed to look like something the Tooth Fairy left behind after visiting - proof that she came, a thank-you for the tooth, and a keepsake of your child's first lost tooth. You can download it as a PDF or JPG, print it at home, and keep it forever.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should the Tooth Fairy write on a certificate?",
    answer:
      "Keep it simple and personal. Name one quality you've noticed growing in your child - kindness, bravery, creativity, curiosity - and add a short line about a real moment you saw it. A few words written in the Tooth Fairy's voice matter far more than anything elaborate. There are ready-to-use examples on this page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the Tooth Fairy take teeth?",
    answer:
      "Not because the teeth themselves are valuable, but because of what's inside them. Every tooth quietly holds a quality the child grew while it was theirs. The Tooth Fairy collects those qualities and uses them to gently help the world. You can read more on our page about why the Tooth Fairy takes teeth.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the Tooth Fairy leave money?",
    answer:
      "The money isn't a payment for the tooth. It's a thank-you - a quiet way of saying the tooth mattered and the quality inside it is now off helping someone, somewhere. The gift is the gesture, not the price.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I save my child's first tooth?",
    answer:
      "Many families do, and the certificate gives the tooth a story to live alongside. Whether you keep the tooth itself or just the keepsake, what you're really saving is a record of who your child was at that moment - and that's the part worth holding onto.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my child asks whether the Tooth Fairy is real?",
    answer:
      "Only you know the right moment and words for your child. Many parents find this tradition gives them a gentle way in - a chance to talk about growing up, about wonder, and about the real qualities children carry, whatever they come to believe about the fairy herself. If it helps, our page 'Is the Tooth Fairy real?' explores that question with care.",

                A first lost tooth arrives with a whole tangle of feelings -
                excitement, a few nervous questions, a little pride, and a good
                deal of wonder. It wobbles for days. Then suddenly it's gone, and
                there's a brand-new gap where it used to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                Often it's the first time a child asks the bigger questions out
                loud. Why does the Tooth Fairy want my tooth? What does she do
                with it? That curiosity is an opening - a chance to turn the
                moment into a quiet conversation about growing up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because a tooth can stand for something. In this story, every
                tooth holds a little of what the child has been growing inside -
                their kindness, their bravery, their patience. The first one most
                of all.

                Sooner or later, most children ask: why does the Tooth Fairy take
                teeth? What does she do with them? Why does she leave money? The
                short film gives them a magical answer - their teeth hold special
                qualities, and the Tooth Fairy uses those qualities to quietly
                help make the world a little better.
